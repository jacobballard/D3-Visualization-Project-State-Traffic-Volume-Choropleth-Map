# D3 Visualization Project: State Traffic Volume Choropleth Map
I made this using data from my previous job at The Eye of the Needle in Lexington, Kentucky. Using Google Analytics I collected web traffic
on theeyeoftheneedle.com including sales by device (Mobile, Tablet, or PC).
This project is a data visualization using d3, a javascript library, showing a Choropleth map of the United States. 
Darker regions of the map indicate higher traffic volume, clicking on a state show the relative revenue on the histogram.
I believed this was actionable data to target regions using Adwords and Facebook Advertising.
